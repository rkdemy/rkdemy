# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Roy Kim, a passionate web developer with a love for building digital experiences. Here's a bit about my journey into the world of web development:

## My Web Dev Journey
After taking a web development unit using ASP.NET and C#, I found myself captivated by the combination of technical, creative and collaborative nature of this field. Coming from a background in ICT, I made the exciting pivot to focus on web development full-time.

One of the aspects that truly drew me to web development was its inherently collaborative nature. Unlike my experience in ICT, web development thrives on teamwork and interaction. Whether it's brainstorming alternative solutions, pair programming, or supporting each other through code challenges and bugs, I've come to cherish the camaraderie and shared growth that comes from working closely with fellow developers. I experienced this in both my Web development unit and my Professional Experience developing ChaseSpace for a client with a team of 4. These experiences reinforced my interest in the industry.
